I'm not writting a code for this lecture, because great part of it demands commands
that I haven't learn yet, as you can see below.

Note: Variable Life Time is the time that a variable is alive. Storage Duration is
the set of rules that governs the Life Time of a variable.

1. Local Storage Duration: Function's variables only exists during the
time the function is been executed. After the block reach its end, the variable
will be wiped out of the memory. 
void example {
	int answer_is {42}; // only exists while the function is been executed.
// IMPORTANT
// This variables are declared inside of a function or block and they have no special prefix
}

2. Static Storage Duration: The variable exists while the programm is running.
// IMPORTANT
// This variables use the prefix "static", example:
static int staticVariable {42};
// They can be inside or outside a function.

3. Dynamic Storage Duration: The lifetime is manually controlled by the devoloper.
// SUPER IMPORTANT
// These variables are allocated inside "heap", which is a memory space 
// destined to be used by dynamic allocation. 
// The devoloper MUST declare space there and MUST delete the space after the use.
// IMPORTANT
// Example:
int* answer {new int}; //declares an int type called "answer", "*" points to a pointer and new is the
// prefix to command heap use.
*answer {42}; // initialize the heap's variable.
delete answer; //deletes it.
//If you don't delete it, the programm may crash after a few loops. 


RESUME:
1. Local (the usual variables)
2. Static (Stars and ends with the programm)
3. Dynamic (The programmer deals with the heap memory to create and delete space there)
